  		A new field lay beneath my window

      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
	<p>But i knew, off in the distance, i was needed. People needed my uniques skills to fork and update people's code. People were wrong on the internet and they needed me to fix it. TO THE GIT CAVE!
	Suddenly the internets ran out, the tubes became clogged with lolcats. We must send some cheeseburgers down to clean them out.</p>
